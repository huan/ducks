Modular and Extensible Redux Reducer Bundles (ducks-modular-redux)

ducks is an implementation of the Ducks proposal.

ducks offers a method of handling redux module packaging.

## Features

1. Encapsulation in Redux
1. Plays nicely with Vanilla Redux
1. Perfrect TypeScript Typing Support powered by [typesafe-actions]().
1. Modulization Friendly
1. Provide TypeScript Interface for Ducks Modular Proposal
1. ActionBinding & SelectorBinding for making non-store & non-mount-point usage with convenience
    1. namespaces auto-management
1. Provide a Ducks Management interface for adding/deleting duck modules
1. Easy to be integrated with naive Redux by adding only one middleware for all ducks.
1. Support using any middleware inside a duck module
1. Make Ducks Modular Proposal to be easy management
1. Support both Frontend & Backend

## Usage

### 1 Create a Modular Ducks (Redux Reducer Bundle)

```ts
export const types = {
  TAP:    'ducks/examples/counter/TAP',
  RESET:  'ducks/examples/counter/RESET',
}

export const actions = {
  tap: () => ({ type: TAP }),
  reset: () => ({ type: RESET })
}

/**
 * CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
 *  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs
 *
 *  1. `operations` for Command
 *  2. `selectors` for Query
 */
export const operations = {
  reset: ({ dispatch }) => dispatch(actions.reset())
}

export const selectors = {
  counter: state => () => state.counter,
}

export default const reducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if (action.type === types.TAP) {
    return ({
      ...state,
      counter: (state.counter || 0) + 1,
    })
  }
}
```

### 2 Load Ducks

```ts
import { Ducks, Duck } from 'ducks'

import { CounterDuck }  from 'ducks/examples/counter/'

const counterDuck = new Duck(CounterDuck)
const finisDuck = new Duck(FinisDuck)

const ducks = new Ducks({
  ducks: [
    counterDuck,
    finisDuck,
  ],
})
```

### 3 Setup Redux with Ducks

```ts
import { createStore, applyMiddleWare } from 'redux'

const initialState = {}
const store = createStore(
  ducks.reducer,
  initialState,
  applyMiddleWare(ducks.middleware),
)
```

You are set!

### 3.1 Shortcut to Configure the Store

If you only use Redux with Ducks, then you can use the shortcut from the Ducks to get the configured store:

```ts
const store = ducks.getStore()
```

The `ducks.getStore()` will do exact the same as the above `createStore()` codes.

## Ducks Directory

a duck:

MUST export default a function called reducer()
MUST export its action creators as functions
MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE
MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library

Here's how a duck folder would look like:

```sh
duck/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ operations.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reducers.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selectors.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js
```

A duck folder:

MUST contain the entire logic for handling only ONE concept in your app, ex: product, cart, session, etc.
MUST have an index.js file that exports according to the original duck rules.
MUST keep code with similar purpose in the same file, ex: reducers, selectors, actions, etc.
MUST contain the tests related to the duck.

## Concepts

Redux Ducks API compares with CQRS, Event Sourcing, and DDD:

| Ducks       | CQRS    | Event Sourcing | DDD  |
| :---        | :---    | :---           | :--- |
| actions     | --- 
| - creator   | Command |
| - payload   | Event   | Event          |      |
| selectors   | Query   |
| operations  | Command + Event |
| middlewares | Aggregate? | Saga ? |
| types       | ??
| reducers    | Aggregate??

> [reSolve](https://reimagined.github.io/resolve/docs/introduction)

### DDD (Domain Driven Design)

Domain aggregate is a business model unit. Business logic is mostly in command handlers for the aggregate.

### ES (Event Sourcing()

Don't store system state, store events that brought system to this state.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

System is divided in two "sides":

- Write Side accepts commands and generate events that stored in the Event Store.
- Read Side applies events to Read Models, and process queries.
